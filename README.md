# Exploding Dots counter

[Exploding Dots](http://gdaymath.com/courses/exploding-dots/) is James Tanton's thing.

It just keeps counting.

## Building

I've used some ES2015 features, so to make it work in older browsers you need to use BabelJS.

Install babel with

```
npm install
```

and then run

```
babel thing.js -o thing.compiled.js
```
